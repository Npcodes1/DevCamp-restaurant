# Purpose
- I created this website while practicing my HTML and CSS skills. It was from a tutorial called Diploma in Website Development Using HTML and CSS that was assigned as apart of my internship. I completed the course and received a certificate.

# What I learned
- This course was really helpful. This was the first time I created a multiple page responsive website. It helped solidify the information I knew, like media queries, form inputs and textareas, and helped me learn more about using flexbox vs grid, skewed headings, customizing placeholder styles, and parallox scrolling.

# What I took away from this?

- In addition to the new information learned, the main thing I took away from this is the ability to create quality code that can be reusable for multiple pages to create an better and easier workflow.
